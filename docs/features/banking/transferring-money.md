## Transfer Limits

### Daily Limits

Some teachers set limits on transfers:

- **Maximum balance**: Highest your savings can go

If limits exist, you'll see a message if you exceed them.

### No Balance Going Negative

**Checking to Savings**:
- Can't transfer more than your checking balance
- Example: Can't transfer $100 if you only have $80

**Savings to Checking**:
- Can't transfer more than your savings balance
- Example: Can't withdraw $200 if savings has $150

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Saving for an Expensive Item

**Goal**: Buy a $500 hall pass bundle

**Strategy**:
1. Keep just enough in checking for daily needs ($50-100)
2. Transfer rest to savings each week
3. Let interest grow your money
4. When you reach $500, transfer to checking and buy

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Transfer $100 → Savings: $100
- Week 2: Transfer $100 → Savings: $200 (+ ~$2 interest)
- Week 3: Transfer $100 → Savings: $300 (+ ~$4 interest)
- Continue until goal reached

### Scenario: Emergency Fund

**Goal**: Always have backup money

**Strategy**:
1. Transfer $50 to savings immediately
2. Each paycheck, transfer 20% to savings
3. Never touch unless emergency
4. Keep building to $200-300

**Benefits**:
- Covered if you get an unexpected fine
- Can handle surprise expenses
- Still earning interest while it sits

### Scenario: Paying Monthly Rent

**Goal**: Have enough for rent every month

**Strategy**:
1. Know your rent amount (e.g., $150/month)
2. Calculate weekly savings needed ($150 ÷ 4 = $37.50/week)
3. Transfer $40 to savings each week
4. Week before rent due, transfer full amount back to checking
5. Pay rent from checking

## Viewing Transfer History

See all your transfers:
1. Go to **Accounts** → **Transactions** tab
2. Look for entries labeled "Transfer"
3. Shows direction (Checking → Savings or vice versa)
4. Shows date, time, and amount

**Transaction details include**:
- **Type**: Transfer
- **Amount**: How much moved
- **From**: Which account money left
- **To**: Which account money went to
- **Balance**: Your new balance after transfer

## Mistakes & Reversals

### Accidental Transfer

**If you transferred wrong amount**:
1. Immediately transfer it back
2. Example: Meant to send $50 but sent $500? Transfer $450 back.

**No undo button**: Transfers can't be undone, but you can reverse them manually.

### Transferred Too Much

**Problem**: Transferred $200 but needed $50 for store

**Solution**:
1. Go to **Transfer** tab
2. Transfer $150 back to checking
3. Now you have $50 available

### Forgot to Transfer Before Shopping

**Problem**: Want to buy something, but money in savings

**Solution**:
1. Check store item price
2. Transfer that amount to checking
3. Then make your purchase
4. (Can't buy directly from savings)

## Tips for Success

### Smart Saving Habits

- **Pay yourself first**: Transfer to savings right after getting paid
- **20% rule**: Save at least 20% of each paycheck
- **Round up**: If you earn $123, save $25 (round to nearest 25)
- **Goal-oriented**: Save with specific purchases in mind

### Avoid Common Mistakes

- ❌ Don't leave all money in checking (you'll spend it)
- ❌ Don't leave all money in savings (can't use it)
- ❌ Don't transfer right before rent is due (might not have enough)
- ❌ Don't forget your passphrase (write it somewhere safe!)

### Finding the Right Balance

**Good checking balance**: 1-2 weeks of expenses
- Enough for daily needs
- Room for small store purchases
- Buffer for rent/insurance

**Good savings balance**: Long-term goals + emergency fund
- 3-4 weeks of income
- Growing with interest
- Earmarked for big purchases

## Calculator: How Much to Save?

**Earning $50/week?**
- Keep in checking: $100 (2 weeks)
- Save weekly: $30-40
- Savings grows: ~$150/month

**Earning $100/week?**
- Keep in checking: $150 (1.5 weeks)
- Save weekly: $60-70
- Savings grows: ~$270/month

**Adjust based on**:
- Your rent amount
- Store item prices
- Your shopping habits
- Interest rate

## Understanding Interest

### How Interest Works

Interest is calculated on your savings balance:
- **Rate**: Set by teacher (e.g., 3%)
- **Frequency**: Usually monthly
- **Calculation**: Balance × Rate
- **Deposit**: Added to savings automatically

**Example**:
- Savings balance: $200
- Interest rate: 3%/month
- Interest earned: $200 × 0.03 = $6
- New balance: $206

### Compound Interest

Interest earns interest:
- Month 1: $200 → earn $6 → $206
- Month 2: $206 → earn $6.18 → $212.18
- Month 3: $212.18 → earn $6.37 → $218.55

**Over time, this adds up!**

### Maximizing Interest

To earn the most interest:
- Transfer to savings early (more time to grow)
- Keep larger balance in savings
- Don't withdraw frequently (let it compound)
- Transfer back only when you need it
