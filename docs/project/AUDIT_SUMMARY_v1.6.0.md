**Date**: January 1, 2026  
**Auditor**: Repository Review Team  
**Version**: 1.6.0

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of the classroom-economy repository completed in preparation for v1.6.0 release. The audit identified and resolved duplicate files, inconsistent paths, outdated documentation, and discovered one partially-built feature (collective goals). All issues have been addressed and the repository is now properly organized for release.

---

## Audit Findings

### 1. Obsolete Files

**Found and Removed (8 files)**:
- `seed_dummy_students.py` (duplicate of scripts/seed_dummy_students.py)
- `create_admin.py` (duplicate of scripts/create_admin.py)
- `add_join_code_column.py` (duplicate of scripts/add_join_code_column.py)
- `check_syntax.py` (duplicate of scripts/check_syntax.py)
- `cleanup_invite_codes.py` (duplicate of scripts/cleanup_invite_codes.py)
- `generate_revision_id.py` (duplicate of scripts/generate_revision_id.py)
- `manage_invites.py` (duplicate of scripts/manage_invites.py)
- `nginx-grafana-fix.conf` (duplicate of deploy/nginx/nginx-grafana-fix.conf)

**Status**: ✅ All removed

### 2. Misplaced Files

**Found and Fixed (1 file)**:
- `app/resources/student_upload_template.csv` - Code referenced root location, docs referenced app/resources. Removed app/resources duplicate, updated docs to reference root location.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Outdated Documentation

**Found and Updated**:
- Version numbers inconsistent (1.4.0 in README, 1.5.0 in CHANGELOG, targeting 1.6.0)
- DEVELOPMENT.md listed announcements as "not yet implemented" but released in v1.4.0
- Recent releases section missing v1.5.0 and v1.6.0
- File path references pointing to wrong locations (scripts vs root)

**Status**: ✅ All updated

### 4. Half-Built Features

**Feature: Collective Goals (Store Items)**

**Status**: 60% Complete
- ✅ Database migration (o2p3q4r5s6t7_add_collective_goal_settings.py)
- ✅ Model fields (StoreItem.collective_goal_type, collective_goal_target)
- ✅ Forms with validation (StoreItemForm)
- ✅ API logic (/api/store/purchase handles thresholds)
- ✅ Student UI (student_shop.html displays progress)
- ❌ Teacher UI for creating collective items
- ❌ Progress indicators on teacher dashboard
- ❌ Notification system for goal completion
- ❌ Documentation

**Recommendation**: Complete for v1.7.0 (2-3 weeks effort)

**Feature: Jobs System**

**Status**: Intentionally Removed (preserved in git history)
- Removed in commit a04b574 (December 2025)
- Complete implementation existed (models, forms, routes, tests)
- Preserved in git history for future restoration
- Documented in DEVELOPMENT.md as future feature

**Recommendation**: Defer to v1.8+ (6-8 weeks effort for restoration and modernization)

## Audit Methodology

1. **File System Analysis**: Listed all files, identified duplicates by comparing checksums
2. **Reference Analysis**: Searched codebase for file references, identified inconsistencies
3. **Documentation Review**: Read all markdown files, verified accuracy and currency
4. **Code Analysis**: Searched for TODO/FIXME/WIP markers, incomplete features
5. **Model Review**: Examined all database models, checked for unused tables
6. **Migration Analysis**: Reviewed migration history, identified orphaned migrations
7. **Feature Status**: Tested routes, checked forms, verified UI completeness
8. **Version Tracking**: Verified version numbers across all documentation

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **File Duplication**: Root-level utility scripts should never duplicate scripts/ directory
2. **Path Consistency**: Code and docs must reference same file locations
3. **Feature Documentation**: Features should be marked as complete in DEVELOPMENT.md when released
4. **Version Management**: All version numbers must be updated simultaneously
5. **Migration Status**: Partially complete features should be clearly documented

---

## Conclusion

The v1.6.0 release audit successfully identified and resolved all organizational issues in the repository. The codebase is now clean, well-organized, and properly documented. One partially-complete feature (collective goals) was identified and documented for completion in v1.7.0. The repository is ready for v1.6.0 release with confidence.

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR RELEASE

**Audit Completed**: January 1, 2026  
**Next Audit**: Recommended for v1.7.0 planning (March 2026)  
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive (files, docs, code, features, organization)
