# Store and Redemptions

## If students cannot see or buy an item, check these first
- The item is active and not auto-delisted.
- Store is enabled in Feature Settings for that period.
- Block visibility limits the item to specific class periods.
- Inventory and per-student limits may block purchases.

## If redemptions are stuck
- Only delayed items require approval; immediate items auto-complete.
- Collective items remain pending until their goal is reached.
- Hall pass items add passes and skip redemption status.

## This is expected when...
- Late rent restrictions block purchases (unless the item is part of rent).
- Bundles and bulk discounts change the purchase description and totals.

## This cannot happen unless...
- An item is purchased without a passphrase (all purchases require it).

## Quick evidence to collect
- Item name, item type, and the student's class period.
- The exact purchase error message.
