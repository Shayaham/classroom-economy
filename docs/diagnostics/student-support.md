# Help and Issue Reports

## If you cannot submit an issue, check these first
- You selected a class (issues are tied to the current join code).
- The transaction or tap event belongs to your current class.


## This is expected when...
- New issues show up with a pending status until your teacher reviews them.
- Transaction issues are limited to your own transactions.

## This cannot happen unless...
- You can view another student's issue list (issues are scoped per student).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The transaction or attendance entry you are reporting.
- The issue category you selected and the message you wrote.
