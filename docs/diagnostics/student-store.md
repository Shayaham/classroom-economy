# Store and Purchases

## If an item is missing from the store, check these first
- Store is enabled for your class period.
- The item is active and not past its auto-delist date.
- The item is visible to your class block (some items are block-specific).

## If a purchase fails, check these first
- You entered the correct passphrase.
- You have enough funds, or overdraft settings allow it.
- You are not late on rent if purchases are restricted when late.
- You have not hit the per-student purchase limit.
- Inventory may be zero even if the item still shows.

## This is expected when...
- Immediate items redeem right away, while delayed items require teacher approval.
- Collective items sit in a pending state until the goal is reached.
- Hall pass items add passes to your balance instead of a redemption.

## This cannot happen unless...
- You purchase an item from another class (items are scoped to your current class).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The item name, price, and error message.
- Whether your class rent status shows late.
