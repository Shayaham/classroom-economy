# Balances, Transfers, and Interest

## If your balance looks wrong, check these first
- You are viewing the correct class (balances are per join code).
- A transaction was voided by your teacher (voided items disappear from totals).
- You are looking at checking vs savings (they are separate ledgers).

## If a transfer fails, check these first
- Banking is enabled for your class period.
- You entered the correct passphrase.
- You have enough funds in the source account.
- You did not choose the same account for both sides.

## This is expected when...
- Savings interest posts monthly, not instantly.
- Interest does not post on days when you moved money into savings.
- Overdraft protection or fees allow a negative checking balance if enabled by your teacher.

## This cannot happen unless...
- Your savings balance goes negative unless a teacher posts a manual transaction; transfers do not overdraw savings.

## Quick evidence to collect
- The class you were in when the transaction happened.
- The exact error message from the transfer form.
