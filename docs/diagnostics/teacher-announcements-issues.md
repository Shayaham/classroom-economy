# Announcements and Issues

## If students do not see an announcement, check these first
- The announcement is active and not expired.
- It is assigned to the correct class periods.
- The student is viewing the matching class context.

## If issues are missing or cannot be submitted
- Issues are scoped per join code; students must pick the correct class.
- Bug reports can be disabled in Feature Settings.
- Only the last 20 issues show on the student help page.

## This is expected when...
- Announcements with expiration dates disappear after the deadline.
- Issues move through pending, resolved, and escalated states.

## This cannot happen unless...
- A student reports a transaction that is not in their class context.

## Quick evidence to collect
- The announcement title, period, and expiration date.
- The issue category and the related transaction ID.
