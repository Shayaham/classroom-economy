# Attendance and Payroll

## If your work time looks missing or wrong, check these first
- You tapped Start Work, Break, and Done in the correct class session.
- You were in the correct class context when you tapped (class switcher matters).
- The payroll feature is enabled for your class period.

## This is expected when...
- You see projected pay before a teacher runs payroll.
- Attendance entries are visible but cannot be edited (the log is append-only).
- Hall pass actions create a tap-out/tap-in entry during your session.

## This cannot happen unless...
- Payroll appears without any attendance activity (only possible with manual payments).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The class period and date of the missing session.
- Whether you used Start, Break, and Done buttons in order.
