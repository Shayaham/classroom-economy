# Classes and Join Codes

## If you cannot join a class, check these first
- Join codes are required and come from your teacher, one per class period.
- If you are already logged in, use Add Class (not Claim Account).
- Your first initial, last name, and date of birth must match your existing account.
- The seat for that join code might already be claimed by someone else.

## If your class list or balances look wrong
- Use the class switcher on the dashboard to select the right join code.
- Balances and history are scoped to the current class, not your whole account.
- If you just added a class, refresh after the success message.

## This is expected when...
- The same teacher gives you multiple join codes (each period is separate).
- Add Class says you are already enrolled (you already have a seat with that teacher).

## This cannot happen unless...
- You see a class without ever entering its join code (a teacher linked you during roster setup).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The join code you used and the block/period it belongs to.
- The exact name and birth date you entered on the form.
