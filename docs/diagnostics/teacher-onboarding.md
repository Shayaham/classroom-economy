# Onboarding and Feature Settings

## If a feature is missing for students, check these first
- Feature Settings can disable features per class period.
- Period-specific settings override global defaults.
- Students must be in the correct class context to see that feature.

## If the getting started widget is gone
- It disappears after you dismiss it.
- You can show it again from **Account Personalization** (Settings → "Show Getting Started Widget" button).
- The widget tracks your progress on setup tasks and can be collapsed/expanded using the floating rocket icon.

## This is expected when...
- Newly created classes start with default feature settings enabled.
- Turning off a feature hides both the menu and the related pages for students.

## This cannot happen unless...
- A disabled feature still appears for students (that is usually a bug).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The period/block where the feature is missing.
- The current Feature Settings values for that period.
