# Student Login and Setup

## If you cannot log in, check these first
- Use the exact username assigned during setup (no nicknames).
- Enter your PIN, not your passphrase.
- Complete setup in this order: claim account -> create username -> set PIN/passphrase.
- The CAPTCHA (Turnstile) must load and be verified before login succeeds.

## This is expected when...
- You are sent to Complete Profile if your account is missing birth date details.
- Login is temporarily blocked after too many attempts (rate limit).
- You see a Claim Account button if your teacher created your account but you have not claimed it yet.

## This cannot happen unless...
- A join code is accepted on the login page (join codes are only for claiming or adding classes).
- A passphrase is required at login (passphrases are only for purchases and transfers).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The exact username you typed and the error text.
- Whether the CAPTCHA widget appeared and was checked.
- Whether you completed the setup flow before logging in.
