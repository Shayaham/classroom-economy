# Hall Passes
## If your request is denied or disappears, check these first
- Hall pass is enabled for your class period.
- You have hall passes available (some teachers require passes for approval).
- The request was rejected or cancelled (pending passes can be cancelled).

## This is expected when...
- A teacher approves a pass and a pass number appears.
- Office, Summons, or Done for the day passes do not deduct from your balance.
- A pass only works at a terminal after it is approved.

## This cannot happen unless...
- A pass shows as returned without ever being marked left (requires a terminal or teacher action).

## Quick evidence to collect
- The pass status (pending, approved, left, returned).
- The reason selected for the pass.
