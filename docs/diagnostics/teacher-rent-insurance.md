# Rent and Insurance

## If rent is not showing for students, check these first
- Rent is enabled for the class period.
- The first due date or preview window has started.
- The student is in the correct class context.

## If rent payments look wrong
- Incremental payments only work when enabled in rent settings.
- Late penalties apply after the grace period.
- Prevent-purchase-when-late can block store access until rent is paid.

## If insurance enrollments or claims fail
- The policy is active and belongs to the current teacher.
- One policy per tier is enforced when tiers are configured.
- Waiting periods, claim limits, and repurchase cooldowns may apply.

## This is expected when...
- Rent items appear in the store only when itemization is enabled.
- Claims are blocked before coverage start dates.

## Quick evidence to collect
- The rent settings for that period and the student's join code.
- The policy name, tier, and claim error details.
