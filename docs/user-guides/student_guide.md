## Account Setup

### Step 1: Claim Your Account
Your teacher provides a **join code** for your class. On the "Claim Account" page, enter:

1. The join code.
2. The **first initial** of your first name.
3. Your **last name**.
4. Your **birthday sum** (month + day + year as numbers, e.g., March 2, 2012 → 3 + 2 + 2012 = **2017**).

### Step 2: Create Your Username
Follow the on-screen prompt to generate a unique username.

### Step 3: Set Your PIN and Passphrase
- **PIN:** Used to log in and for quick actions like clocking in.
- **Passphrase:** Used for sensitive actions like purchases.

Keep both private and memorable.

## Logging In
Use your username and PIN on the student login page. If you forget them, ask your teacher for help recovering your account.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is your home base. It shows:

- **Announcements** from your teacher.
- **Current class info** (teacher name, period, join code).
- **Balances** for checking and savings.
- **Hall pass balance** (if enabled).
- **Quick actions** for starting work, taking breaks, and finishing work.
- **Recent activity** like transactions and store updates.

## Classes and Join Codes
If you are in more than one class, you can switch between them:

- Use the **class switcher** to change which class you are viewing.
- Use **Add Class** to join another class with a new join code.

Each class has its own balances, settings, and activity.

## Accounts and Transactions
The **Accounts** page includes three tabs:

- **Accounts:** Checking and savings balances, total earnings, interest rate, and savings projections.
- **Transfer:** Move money between checking and savings.
- **Transactions:** Full ledger of activity (payroll, purchases, rent, fines, rewards).

If a transaction looks wrong, use the **report** icon next to it to submit an issue.

## Store and Hall Passes
The **Store** lets you spend earnings on classroom items.

- Browse items, prices, and limits.
- Purchase items using your passphrase.
- Track owned items and usage history.
- **Hall pass items** add to your pass balance; requesting a pass notifies your teacher.

## Bills: Rent and Insurance
The **Bills** section keeps you updated on classroom expenses.
