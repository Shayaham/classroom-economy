# Attribution & Project Philosophy

This project exists to provide teachers with a **complete, inspectable, and ethical classroom economy system**.

It is built on the work of many open-source contributors and services, whose efforts are acknowledged with respect and care.

---

## Purpose

**Classroom Token Hub** was created to fill a gap in educational technology: a free, transparent, and privacy-respecting platform for teaching financial literacy through hands-on classroom banking simulations.

The intent of this project is **educational, not extractive**.

- **Use is encouraged** for learning and teaching
- **Monetization of the software itself is not permitted**
- **Transparency, minimal data collection, and teacher autonomy** are core design principles

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Educational First

This platform is designed for classrooms, not commerce. Every feature prioritizes the learning experience and teacher control over profit or scale.

### 2. Privacy & Security

- **Student data is encrypted at rest** - All personally identifiable information (PII) is protected
- **Minimal data collection** - We only collect what's necessary for the classroom economy simulation
- **No tracking or analytics** - No third-party analytics or advertising
- **Teacher ownership** - Teachers control their data and can export or delete it at any time

### 3. Transparency

- **Open source** - All code is publicly available for inspection
- **Clear licensing** - The PolyForm Noncommercial License ensures the software remains free
- **Documented architecture** - Technical documentation explains how the system works
- **No hidden features** - What you see is what you get

### 4. Accessibility

- **Free to use** - No cost for educators or students
- **Simple deployment** - Can be self-hosted or deployed by schools
- **Comprehensive documentation** - User guides and technical references included
- **Community support** - Open to contributions and improvements

---

## Acknowledgments

This project stands on the shoulders of giants. We gratefully acknowledge:

### Open Source Communities

The Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and broader open-source communities whose tools and libraries make this platform possible. See [Third-Party Notices](/docs/legal/third-party-notices) for specific attributions.

### Educators

Teachers who provided feedback, feature requests, and real-world insights that shaped this platform into a practical classroom tool.

### Contributors

All contributors who have submitted code, documentation, bug reports, and suggestions to improve the platform.

---

## Ethical Stance

### Against Extraction

We reject business models that:

- Extract value from educators through subscription fees
- Lock essential features behind paywalls
- Monetize student data through advertising or analytics
- Create vendor lock-in through proprietary formats

### For Empowerment

We believe in:

- **Teacher autonomy** - Educators should control their tools and data
- **Student privacy** - Young people deserve protection, not profiling
- **Community ownership** - Educational tools should belong to education, not shareholders
- **Sustainable sharing** - Open source licenses preserve freedom while preventing exploitation

---

## Commercial Services vs. Software Monetization

This project permits commercial entities to offer **services** around the software (hosting, support, deployment) but prohibits **monetization of the software itself** (subscriptions, per-seat pricing, feature paywalls).

See [Commercial Use Policy](/docs/legal/commercial) for the complete commercial use policy.

The distinction is intentional:

- **Services** require ongoing labor and infrastructure - fair to charge for
- **Software access** is a one-time work product - should remain free

---

## License Rationale

We chose the **PolyForm Noncommercial License** because:

1. It keeps the software free for educators and nonprofits
2. It prevents commercial exploitation while allowing commercial services
3. It's legally clear and internationally recognized
4. It aligns with our educational mission

See [License](/docs/legal/license) for the full license text.
