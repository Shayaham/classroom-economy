# Commercial Use Policy

This project is licensed to ensure that the software itself remains free, open, and non-commercial, while allowing others to offer services around it.

**The intent of this policy is to prevent monetization of the software, features, or updates, while permitting monetization of labor and infrastructure.**

This document is intentionally explicit. Ambiguity will be interpreted conservatively.

---

## Permitted Commercial Activities (Services Only)

Commercial entities may charge fees **only** for services that are external to the software itself, including:

- **Hosting or infrastructure costs** (e.g., servers, uptime, backups)
- **Deployment, setup, or installation assistance**
- **Ongoing operations and maintenance** of hosted instances
- **Technical support and troubleshooting**
- **Service-level agreements (SLAs)**
- **Managed or turn-key deployments** for schools or districts

**These fees may include reasonable profit margins for the service provision itself (labor, infrastructure, support), but may not include charges for access to, use of, or features within the software.**

**Key Distinction:** You may charge for **your work** (hosting, support, deployment), but not for **the software** (features, access, licenses).

---

## Prohibited Commercial Activities (Software Monetization)

Commercial entities may **not**, under any circumstances:

- Charge for access to the software
- Charge per seat, per user, per student, or per teacher
- Sell licenses or subscriptions to the software
- Restrict, gate, or throttle features based on payment
- Offer paid tiers (e.g., "basic", "pro", "enterprise")
- Charge for updates, upgrades, or new features
- Charge for bug fixes or security patches
- Repackage the software as a proprietary or closed product
- Represent the software as their own or obscure its origin

**Any attempt to recharacterize software access or features as a "service" will be treated as a violation of the license.**

## Clarifying Examples (Non-Exhaustive)

### Allowed Examples

**Allowed:** A company hosts the software for teachers and charges a monthly hosting fee (e.g., $50/month for server costs + support).

**Allowed:** A district pays a vendor $5,000 to deploy and configure the software on the district's infrastructure.

**Allowed:** A provider offers support contracts or uptime guarantees (e.g., $100/month for 24/7 support).

**Allowed:** A consultant charges $150/hour to help a school configure payroll, store items, and rent settings.

**Allowed:** A hosting company offers managed instances with guaranteed uptime, backups, and technical support for a monthly service fee.

### Not Allowed Examples

**Prohibited:** Charging teachers to "unlock" features or modules (e.g., "$10/month for hall pass feature").

**Prohibited:** Charging for updates, patches, or bug fixes (e.g., "Pay $50 to get version 1.7").

**Prohibited:** Selling a hosted version with exclusive or enhanced functionality not available in the open-source version.

**Prohibited:** Branding the software as a proprietary product or platform (e.g., "SchoolBankPro powered by our technology").

**Prohibited:** Offering tiered pricing based on feature access (e.g., "Basic: $20/month for 50 students; Pro: $50/month for unlimited students").

**Prohibited:** Charging per-user, per-seat, or per-student pricing models (e.g., "$2 per student per month").

**Prohibited:** Requiring payment to access critical bug fixes or security patches (all users must receive these for free).

**These examples are illustrative, not limiting.**

### Gray Areas Clarified

**Q: Can I charge different service fees based on instance size or resource usage?**
A: Yes, if the pricing reflects actual infrastructure costs (e.g., larger database, more server resources, higher bandwidth). No, if it's based on feature access or user counts within the software.

**Q: Can I offer a "premium support" tier with faster response times?**
A: Yes, different service levels (response time, availability, SLAs) are permitted. The software features themselves must remain identical across all service tiers.

**Q: Can I charge more for commercial organizations vs nonprofits?**
A: For services (hosting, support): Yes, you may set your own service pricing. For the software itself: No, because commercial organizations are already prohibited from using the software under the PolyForm Noncommercial License.

**Q: Can I include this software as part of a larger paid service offering?**
A: Only if the software itself remains free and separately available. You cannot bundle it in a way that requires payment to access it. The software's availability and features cannot be conditioned on purchasing your other services.

**All bug fixes, security fixes, and general improvements made by commercial entities must be contributed back to the upstream project.**

Forks that exist solely to avoid this obligation are not permitted for commercial use.
