# Multi-Tenancy Violations Audit

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Branch:** fix-multitenancy-violations
**Severity:** CRITICAL (P0)

## Executive Summary

Systematic audit revealed **15 instances** of multi-tenancy violations across **6 template files** where student balances are displayed without proper `join_code` scoping. This causes students enrolled in multiple class periods to see aggregated balances across all classes instead of period-specific balances.

## Impact

**Affected Users:**
- Students enrolled in multiple periods with the same or different teachers
- Teachers viewing student details or payroll for multi-period students

**Data Leak:**
- Students see combined balances from all periods
- Teachers see aggregated balances that don't match any single period
- Financial reports are inaccurate for multi-period scenarios

## Violations Found

### ✅ FIXED: admin_students.html (Student Roster)
**Status:** Fixed in commit e5d8cf6
**Lines:** 384-390
**Fix:** Added `student_balances_by_block` dictionary with proper join_code scoping

---

### ❌ PENDING: student_detail.html (Admin View - Student Detail Page)
**File:** templates/student_detail.html
**Violations:** 5 instances
**Severity:** HIGH (Admin-facing, affects teacher decisions)

**Lines:**
- Line 51-52: `student.checking_balance` - Balance card
- Line 62: `student.savings_balance` - Balance card
- Line 72: `student.total_earnings` - Balance card
- Line 541: `student.total_earnings` - Financial summary section

**Issue:** When teacher clicks on a student from a specific class tab, the detail page shows aggregated balances from ALL periods instead of the selected period's balances.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Pass `join_code` context from referring page (via query parameter or session)
2. Calculate scoped balances in `student_detail()` route
3. Update template to use scoped balances

---

### ❌ PENDING: student_payroll.html (Student View - Payroll Page)
**File:** templates/student_payroll.html
**Violations:** 2 instances
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Student-facing, affects understanding of earnings)

**Lines:**
- Line unknown: `student.total_earnings` (appears twice)

**Issue:** Student sees total earnings from ALL periods instead of current period.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Get current period's `join_code` from session (`current_join_code`)
2. Use `student.get_total_earnings(join_code=join_code)`

---

### ❌ PENDING: student_transfer.html (Student View - Transfer Page)
**File:** templates/student_transfer.html
**Violations:** 1 instance
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Student-facing, but informational only)

**Lines:**
- Line unknown: `student.total_earnings`

**Issue:** Transfer page shows total earnings from all periods.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Get current period's `join_code` from session
2. Use `student.get_total_earnings(join_code=join_code)`

---

### ❌ PENDING: mobile/student_dashboard.html (Student Mobile View)
**File:** templates/mobile/student_dashboard.html
**Violations:** 3 instances
**Severity:** HIGH (Primary student view on mobile)

**Lines:**
- Line unknown: `student.checking_balance` - Dashboard card
- Line unknown: `student.savings_balance` - Dashboard card
- Line unknown: `student.checking_balance + student.savings_balance` - Total calculation

**Issue:** Mobile dashboard shows aggregated balances from all periods.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Get current period's `join_code` from session
2. Use scoped balance methods:
   - `student.get_checking_balance(join_code=join_code)`
   - `student.get_savings_balance(join_code=join_code)`

---

### ❌ PENDING: mobile/student_rent.html (Student Mobile View - Rent)
**File:** templates/mobile/student_rent.html
**Violations:** 2 instances
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Affects rent payment validation)

**Lines:**
- Line unknown: `student.checking_balance` - Display balance
- Line unknown: `student.checking_balance < status.remaining_amount` - Payment validation

**Issue:**
- Shows wrong balance for rent payment
- **Payment validation may incorrectly allow/deny rent payments** based on aggregated balance

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Get current period's `join_code` from session
2. Use `student.get_checking_balance(join_code=join_code)`
3. **Critical:** Ensure backend rent payment also validates with scoped balance

---

### ❌ PENDING: admin_payroll.html (Admin View - Payroll Page)
**File:** templates/admin_payroll.html
**Violations:** 2 instances
**Severity:** HIGH (Affects payroll decisions)

**Lines:**
- Line unknown: `student.checking_balance` - Payroll table
- Line unknown: `student.savings_balance` - Payroll table

**Issue:** Payroll page shows aggregated balances instead of period-specific balances.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Get current period's `join_code` from session (already stored in admin session)
2. Calculate scoped balances in `payroll()` route
3. Pass scoped balances to template

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Correct Patterns

**Student Model Methods (models.py:167-270):**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use these methods
student.get_checking_balance(join_code=join_code)
student.get_savings_balance(join_code=join_code)
student.get_total_earnings(join_code=join_code)

# ❌ WRONG - Do not use these properties for scoped queries
student.checking_balance  # Aggregates ALL transactions
student.savings_balance   # Aggregates ALL transactions
student.total_earnings    # Aggregates ALL transactions
```

### Session Context

**Admin Session:**
```python
session['admin_id']  # Current teacher
session['current_join_code']  # Selected class period
```

**Student Session:**
```python
session['student_id']  # Current student
session['current_join_code']  # Selected class period (if student in multiple classes)
```

## Recommended Fix Order

1. **CRITICAL (P0):** mobile/student_rent.html - Affects payment validation
2. **HIGH (P1):** student_detail.html - Affects teacher decisions
3. **HIGH (P1):** mobile/student_dashboard.html - Primary student view
4. **HIGH (P1):** admin_payroll.html - Affects payroll decisions
5. **MEDIUM (P2):** student_payroll.html - Informational only
6. **MEDIUM (P2):** student_transfer.html - Informational only

---

## Testing Requirements

For each fix, verify:

1. **Student with single period:** Balances match transaction totals
2. **Student with multiple periods (same teacher):** Each period shows different balances
3. **Student with multiple periods (different teachers):** Complete isolation
4. **Period switching:** Balances update when switching periods

### Test Scenario

```
Given:
  - Student "Alice" enrolled in Period 1 and Period 2 with Teacher Bob
  - Period 1 transactions: +$100 checking, +$50 savings
  - Period 2 transactions: +$200 checking, +$75 savings

When viewing Period 1:
  - Checking balance should show: $100
  - Savings balance should show: $50
  - Total should show: $150

When viewing Period 2:
  - Checking balance should show: $200
  - Savings balance should show: $75
  - Total should show: $275

Currently (BROKEN):
  - All views show: $300 checking, $125 savings (aggregated)
```
